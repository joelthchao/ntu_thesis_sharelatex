In object detection, many works based on part-based model such as the Deformable Part Model (DPM) \cite{voc-release5}.

To tackle the problem, we proposed Regularized Sparse Coding which is optimized for filter functionality\protect\footnotemark[1].

\footnotetext[1]{In this work we call the ability of filter to produce accurate score map in object detection as \textit{filter functionality}.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We propose Regularized Sparse Coding to reconstruct filter functionality which sparse coding cannot reconstruct successfully.
  \item We conduct experiments on several large datasets with up to 200 classes to prove scalability of our method. 
  \item We achieve 16 times speedup using only 1.25\% memory with less than 0.04 mAP drop compared to the original Deformable Part Model.
\end{itemize}
