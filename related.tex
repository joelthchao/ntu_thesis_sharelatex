In general, object detection can be reduced to proposal extraction and object classification. So, the computational complexity of object detection could be $\mathcal{O}(LC)$, where L is the number of proposals and C is the number of classes. These two stages and the impacts on scalability are discussed separately in this section.

\section{Proposal Extraction}

From the famous cascade method \cite{viola2001rapid}, many works ...

\section{Object Classification}

With the exception of few object detection frameworks \cite{chen2013efficient, murphy2006object} ...
